# HCV_prison_model
This is a mathematical model for simulating HCV treatment and prevention programs in an Australian prison setting.
The software consists of three files: 
1. individual.h - contains the structure of each individual
2. individual.c - contains the functions relating to individuals
3. main.c - contains the main code

A separate version of the code has been created for each scenario analysed in this study: 
1. scale-up of direct-acting antiviral treatment in prisons (DAA)
2. scale-up of opioid substitution therapy in prisons (OST)
3. introduction of needle and syringe program in prisons (NSP)
4. projection of DAA treatment outside of the prisons
5. combination of treatment and prevention strategies

The manual containing a detailed discussion of the code can be found in the documents folder.
